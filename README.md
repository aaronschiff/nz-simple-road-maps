# New Zealand roads map in R: Example

This is an example of how to make a map of lines (New Zealand roads) in R. The road data can be downloaded from: https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/329-nz-road-centrelines-topo-150k/. The output is a single PNG file containing six small maps showing roads with different characteristics (sealed, metalled, state highways, etc).
